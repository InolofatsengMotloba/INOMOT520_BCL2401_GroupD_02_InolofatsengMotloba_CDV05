# CDV05 | Simple Developer Portfolio Website ðŸŽ¨

## Objective
I created a very simple developer portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information. This project helped me demonstrate my ability to design and develop a personal website that combines design and user experience, project showcase, content quality, and technical proficiency. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Credits: Arnaud Balland - Codepen)
